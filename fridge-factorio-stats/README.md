# Fridge Factorio Stats

Semi-realtime Factorio overlay for **XSplit Broadcaster** (also works in OBS Browser Source).

Shows:
- **Power production / consumption** (accurate when using Wiretap mod)
- **Research progress** + queue
- **Kill count** (enemies killed by your force)
- **Death count** (player deaths this map)
- **Evolution factor**
- **Live in-game alerts** (biter attacks, turret fire, low power, etc.)

## Architecture

```
Factorio  ──RCON──►  Node Bridge  ──WebSocket──►  Overlay (HTML)
   │                     ▲
   └── Wiretap JSON ─────┘   (optional, for perfect power numbers)
```

1. **Factorio mod** (`fridge-factorio-stats`) – tracks deaths, kills, research, alerts and answers the `/fridge-stats` RCON command.
2. **Node bridge** – polls RCON every 2 s, optionally watches Wiretap’s `stats.json`, merges everything and pushes to clients over WebSocket.
3. **Overlay** – transparent HTML/CSS/JS page you load as an XSplit Webpage source.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable RCON in Factorio

Edit `%APPDATA%\Factorio\config\config.ini` (or create the section if missing):

```ini
[other]
local-rcon-socket=127.0.0.1:25575
local-rcon-password=factorio
```

Restart Factorio after saving.

> Use a stronger password if the machine is shared. The bridge reads the password from the environment or the default `factorio`.

### 2. Install the Factorio mod

Copy the whole `mod/` folder into your Factorio mods directory and rename it (or zip it) so Factorio sees:

```
%APPDATA%\Factorio\mods\fridge-factorio-stats_1.0.0\
  ├── info.json
  └── control.lua
```

Or zip the contents of `mod/` as `fridge-factorio-stats_1.0.0.zip`.

Enable the mod in the Factorio mods menu and start / load a game.

If you still have `xsplit-factorio-stats_1.0.0` installed, disable or delete that folder so Factorio only loads the Fridge mod. `/xsplit-stats` remains an alias.

### 3. (Strongly recommended) Install Wiretap for accurate power

1. Download **Wiretap – Stats Exporter** (`hmph-wiretap`) from the Factorio mod portal.
2. Enable it. It writes `%APPDATA%\Factorio\script-output\wiretap\stats.json` every few seconds with full electric-network production & consumption numbers.
3. The bridge automatically detects and merges that file.

Without Wiretap the overlay still works but power numbers are only approximate.

### 4. Run the bridge

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

You should see:

```
=== Fridge Factorio Stats Bridge ===
HTTP/WS listening on http://localhost:3847
Overlay URL for XSplit: http://localhost:3847/overlay.html
…
[RCON] Connected to 127.0.0.1:25575
```

Environment variables you can override:

| Variable          | Default                          | Meaning                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `RCON_HOST`       | `127.0.0.1`                      | Factorio RCON host         |
| `RCON_PORT`       | `25575`                          | Factorio RCON port         |
| `RCON_PASSWORD`   | `factorio`                        | RCON password              |
| `PORT`            | `3847`                           | HTTP + WebSocket port      |
| `WIRETAP_PATH`    | `%APPDATA%\…\wiretap\stats.json` | Path to Wiretap JSON       |

### 5. Add sources in XSplit

You can use the **full combined overlay** or any **individual stat** as its own Webpage source.

#### Full overlay (everything in one panel)
```
http://localhost:3847/overlay.html
```
Suggested size: ~420 × 400 px

#### Individual stream sources (place each wherever you want)

| Stat            | URL                                          | Suggested size   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Power**       | `http://localhost:3847/power.html`           | 280 × 160 px     |
| **Research**    | `http://localhost:3847/research.html`        | 280 × 160 px     |
| **Kills**       | `http://localhost:3847/kills.html`           | 200 × 120 px     |
| **Deaths**      | `http://localhost:3847/deaths.html`          | 200 × 120 px     |
| **Evolution**   | `http://localhost:3847/evolution.html`       | 200 × 120 px     |
| **Combat**      | `http://localhost:3847/combat.html`          | 280 × 150 px     |
| **Alerts**      | `http://localhost:3847/alerts.html`          | 320 × 220 px     |

All sources share the same live WebSocket feed from the bridge — add as many as you like, they stay in sync.

1. In XSplit → **Add source** → **Webpage**
2. Paste one of the URLs above
3. Set the size (or crop) to fit your layout
4. Transparent background is already handled

You can also open any URL in a browser to preview.

## What each source shows

| Source      | Data                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power**   | Production + consumption (Wiretap), load bar, accumulator charge    |
| **Research**| Current tech name, progress bar, queue / researched count           |
| **Kills**   | Total enemies killed by your force                                   |
| **Deaths**  | Player deaths this map                                               |
| **Evolution**| Enemy evolution factor                                              |
| **Combat**  | Kills + Deaths + Evolution in one card                               |
| **Alerts**  | Live list of in-game alerts (biter attacks, turret engaged, etc.)   |
| **Full**    | All of the above in a single panel                                   |

Updates arrive roughly every 2 seconds (RCON poll) and immediately when Wiretap writes a new file.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                        | Fix                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Status stays “CONNECTING…”     | Is the Node bridge running? Is the port free?                      |
| RCON never connects            | Check `config.ini`, password, and that a game is actually loaded   |
| Power shows “install Wiretap”  | Install & enable `hmph-wiretap`, then restart the bridge            |
| No alerts appear               | Alerts only show while they are active in-game                     |
| Deaths stay at 0               | The mod must be loaded *before* any deaths occur (or die once)     |
| Overlay looks cut off          | Increase the Webpage source size in XSplit                         |

## Notes / Limitations

- **Power accuracy** relies on the excellent Wiretap mod. The built-in approximation only counts max prototype production of generators and is not reliable for live demand.
- **Kill counts** are total entities killed *by* the player force on the primary surface (nauvis by default). Very large kill tables are trimmed in the file export.
- **Alerts** come from `player.get_alerts()`. The exact set of alert types depends on the Factorio version and active mods.
- The bridge is local-only by design. Do not expose port 3847 to the internet without authentication.

Enjoy the stream!
